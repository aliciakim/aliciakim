            Hello! I'm Alicia.

            <div>.</div>

            I am currently working in consumer analytics @ Nielsen SF.  

            I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Cognitive Science with a focus in computational modeling and I minored in journalism. During university, I was a member of the engineering sorority Phi Sigma Rho, a journalist at The Daily Californian, and a research assistant @ Kayser Lab.  

            <div>.</div>

            I enjoy reading and running in my free time, and I write words and code as a creative outlet and a (constantly frustrating, but surprisingly rewarding) learning experience. My post-graduation goals include running my first full marathon, improving my fluency in Korean beyond the capacity of an elevator conversation, and putting my kitchen (and not my smoke detector) to better use.

                I completed the UC Berkeley Journalism minor during the summer of 2017.  I am definitely still much more comfortable reading (fiction, data-driven journalism, and an occasional cooking blog are my top choices) than I am writing or public speaking... but in the spirit of practice makes perfect, you can see some of my work at my college newspaper (The Daily Californian) <a href = "https://dailycal.org/author/akim"> here, </a> as a contributing team member at Pink Box Stories <a href = ""> here </a>, and as a writer for the Division of Data Science <a href = ""> here </a>.

                After taking New Media 190 at Berkeley, I became interested in using technology to design for the community.  You can read about some
                of the projects 
                At Berkeley, I learned that we can design technology to impact the community. I worked on Community Engagement Design <a href = "https://medium.com/@aliciakim_74942/uc-berkeley-critical-practices-provocations-983de018b8c6"> Projects </a>
                I never would have guessed I would have learned how to laser cut and cad in college, but I'm so glad that I did.  I took the 3D Modeling and Animation DeCal and learned
                how to navigate the production pipeline.  I worked on a semester long project, which you can find <a href = "https://youtu.be/ySFhnzUewtM"> here </a>!

                of my summer internship <a href = "https://medium.com/@aliciakim_74942/my-nielsen-experience-bold-moves-6cb49726f609"> here.</a>
                <div></div>
                I also worked as a research assistant at the
                <a href = "https://kayserlab.ucsf.edu/"> Kayser Lab</a>, on an fMRI study of the neural correlates of perceptual decision making.
